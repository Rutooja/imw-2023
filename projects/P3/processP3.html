                <h2>Development of the hover effect over the years</h2>
                <p>
                    The concept of hover interaction has its roots in the developments of graphical user interfaces and
                    the evolution of input devices. There are several instances that can connect to the birth of the
                    hover effect. One of them is the invention of a mouse by Douglas Engelbart in the 1960s. The mouse
                    allowed users to <MARK>move</MARK> a cursor on the screen and as a result, designers began
                    exploring ways to
                    provide feedback when the cursor was positioned over an element. Many other factors also impacted,
                    like Apple’s
                    Macintosh from 1984 which features a mouse and graphical elements, then Microsoft Windows in the
                    1990s, users could hover over desktop icons, buttons, and other UI elements to receive visual
                    feedback. Then with the development of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the 1990s-2000s and the CSS
                    hover pseudo-class, the hover interaction became mainstream. It is, however, still in the beginning
                    phases of being applied to all touchscreen devices.

                    Considering the hover effect's historical timeline, it appears intricately connected with mouse
                    movement.

                    In today's context, "hover" is characterized as an interactive visual change when a user positions
                    their cursor over a webpage element without clicking. My exploration of widely-used hover effects
                    encompassed examples like hamburger menu interactions, card highlighting, zooming upon hover, and
                    more.

                    Contemplating the idea, I posed a question to myself: What if the entire screen could be treated as
                    an "element" to interact with through hovering? This query initiated a deep dive into discovering
                    mouse trail effects using JavaScript.

                <h2>Concept</h2>
                <p>
                    The genesis of this project coincided with the celebration of Diwali, a significant festival for me.
                    As an international student unable to partake in traditional festivities, I conceived this project
                    as a unique way to "celebrate" Diwali.

                    During Diwali, customary celebrations involve bursting firecrackers and sparklers (fuljhadi).
                    While I refrained from these practices due to environmental concerns, the nostalgia of childhood
                    enjoyment lingered. The project aimed to encapsulate the essence of firecrackers, not in a direct
                    form, but as an iteration or variation. Specifically, I envisioned capturing the vibrant colors
                    reminiscent of fireworks at night.

                    Additionally, the balls were inspired by the circluar motion by
                    which we move the sparklers. Hence, I decided to represent the "fireworks" with circles.

                    To sum up, balls follow the mouse exclusively during screen-hover, remaining absent during periods
                    of inactivity.

                <h2>Code</h2>
                <p>
                    To tie my ideas together, I looked up a lot of videos on YouTube and found the following video which
                    I
                    started my assignment.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEptSB3fbqM
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Part 1: I created a canvas for rendering the balls on the screen. I created an empty array as it is
                    dynamic,
                    it allows continuous creation, rendering, and removal of balls during the animation loop.

                <!-- End of image with caption -->
                <p>
                    Part 2: The constructor function ‘Ball’ is used for creating objects that represent balls. The
                    initial
                    radius is set to 20 and I have used hsl (hue, saturation, and lightness) which gives the perfect
                    colors I was looking for, took this reference from the video linked above.
                    Since I wanted to move the balls around the screen to represent the “fireworks”, I had to set the
                    random values generated to be positive and negative in the x and y directions. Also, the larger ball
                    sizes move faster than the smaller ones and all balls also keep reducing in size.

                <p>
                    Part 3: This function is the animation loop which iterates over each ball in the array, draws it on
                    the
                    canvas, updates its properties, and removes balls that have become very small.

                <!-- End of image with caption -->
                <p>
                    Part 4: To determine the position of the mouse pointer, clientX, a property by DOM is used to locate
                    the
                    coordinates. With each mouse movement, 5 balls are added to the array.
                    <br>

                <p>
                    Part 5: This function animation clears the canvas, calls renderBalls function, and adds a variation
                    of color by incrementing hue by 1.

                    JavaScript required quite some
                    learning and lots of troubleshooting. I did take assistance of ChatGPT as well.
