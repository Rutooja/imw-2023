    <p class="question">
        1. Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please
        explain your answer.
    </p>


    <p class="answer">
        Laurel Schwulst advocates for individual websites over social media, as she believes that popular social media
        platforms prioritize advertising and don’t necessarily consider user’s happiness, needs, or privacy. She
        suggests that people, especially artists, should reclaim the internet’s original space by having their own
        websites that provide creative freedom and a direct connection with the public.
        I agree with Schwulst’s perspective as personal websites offer more control and are more authentic compared to
        the algorithmic constraints and privacy concerns of social media. In the digital world, which is dominated by
        commercial interests, having a personal website allows for more genuine self-expression and a unique online
        presence. Having this creative freedom enables creators to shape the web’s future and maintain a more meaningful
        connection with their audience.

    <p class="question">
        In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a paragraph
        describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend that
        comparison. Upload it to your Github server and post the link here. </p>

    <p class="answer">
        I believe that each website is like a star in the night sky and possesses a unique celestial presence within the
        digital galaxy. Similar to how stars stand out with their shine in the vastness of space, each website shines
        with its distinct luminosity, contributing to the online universe. The content of a website acts like a radiant
        illumination emitted by a star, which consists of informative articles, visuals, and interactive features. This
        content shines brightly, attracting digital observers and guiding them through the expansive cosmos of
        information, creating an informative journey for online users.

        Digital stars, exert a pull on users by making them engage in content and interactive features, creating a
        gravitational force that draws individuals into their digital orbit. The connectivity between websites mirrors
        the gravitational forces binding stars in a galaxy, forming a network of hyperlinks and shared content that
        promotes seamless travel through the digital galaxy. Users, just like astronomers exploring stars, seek
        insights, entertainment, or information from the digital stars scattered across space on the internet.
