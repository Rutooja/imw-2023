    <p class="question">
        1. What is the thesis of this article?
    </p>


    <p class="answer">
        Frank Chimero’s article revolves around the central idea that the design of screens and digital interfaces
        should have characteristics, particularly their ability to change, move, and adapt, which he has termed “flux”.
        He suggests that an effective design should ideally concentrate more on functionality, and usability and less on
        aesthetics or metaphors. He says that screens and technology are not fixed but fluid. He encourages designers
        that instead of showing pictures or information, screens can change and adapt to what people need, making it
        easier for them to use. Moreover, he suggests that designers should develop a vocabulary to describe design
        behaviors and transformations accurately. He says this terminology can be borrowed from various backgrounds like
        animation, theatre, puppetry, dance, and choreography.
        Ultimately, he emphasizes that we have the power to shape technology that would align better with our values and
        needs, thus enabling a more harmonious relationship between users and screens.

    <p class="question">
        2. Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo? </p>

    <p class="answer">
        Although I would be in favor of flat design more than skeuo, I believe each of these designs has its merits and
        a balanced blend would result in a more user-friendly interface.
        As an architect myself, I genuinely love the characteristics of flat design which are simple, clear, and focus
        on a minimalistic approach which makes the interfaces concise and away from any distractions. It can be
        beneficial in navigating through the contents of any mobile application or web design where straightforward
        navigation and readability are essential.
        On the other hand, skeuo, with its use of familiar real-world elements, can provide users with certain cues that
        would ease digital interactions. As Chimero gives an example of the icon of the garbage can, users can relate
        and understand that it is trash and unwanted files go there.
        In conclusion, I believe, the goal of a designer should be to produce a design that users can navigate through
        easily.

    <p class="question">
        3. What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another example from
        filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.
    </p>


    <p class="answer">
        A zoopraxiscope was a device used in the 19th century to create the illusion of motion from a series of still
        photographs. It consisted of a spinning glass disk with sequential images, and when illuminated and rotated, it
        gave the impression of a moving image. This represents a form of animation and motion. In web and interaction
        design, understanding these elements is crucial for creating engaging and user-friendly interfaces. For example,
        UI designers wireframe and prototype which helps in visualizing the flow and interaction of a digital product
        before it is built. It ensures that the user's journey through the interface is easy to navigate. Designers use
        animation to provide feedback to users when they interact with elements on a website or app, making the
        experience more intuitive and visually appealing.
