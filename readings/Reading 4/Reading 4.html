    <p class="question">
        1. How does Manovich see the opposition between database and narrative? Manovich talks about computer games as a
        form of Interactive Narrative. Can you speculate on other forms of interactive narratives (in our culture or
        imagined) that aren't computer games?
    </p>


    <p class="answer">
        According to Manovich, databases and narratives are enemies, competing for the same territory of human culture.
        While a narrative creates a cause-and-effect trajectory of seemingly unordered items (events), a database
        represents the world as a list of items and refuses to order this list.
        Regarding interactive narratives, Manovich mentions that narratives and games are similar in that the user,
        while proceeding through them, must uncover its underlying logic - its algorithm. Just like a game player, a
        reader of a novel gradually reconstructs an algorithm that the writer used to create the settings, the
        characters, and the events.
        Manovich focuses on computer games as a form of interactive narrative but there are other forms of interactive
        narratives that exist or could be imagined. For example, interactive books allowing readers to shape the
        narrative, escape rooms, and immersive theater experiences all involve some degree of interactivity and allow
        the audience to shape the narrative in some way. In the future, we might see new forms of interactive narratives
        emerge as technology continues to evolve.

    <p class="question">
        2. Database as Symbolic Form was written 19 years ago now. What has changed? What hasn't changed? Did Manovich's
        predictions come true? </p>

    <p class="answer">
        Since "Database as Symbolic Form" was written 19 years ago, there have been significant changes in the way we
        interact with and use databases. For example, the rise of social media platforms and the increasing amount of
        data generated by users has led to the development of new techniques for managing and analyzing large datasets.
        Additionally, the increasing use of artificial intelligence and machine learning has enabled more sophisticated
        data processing and analysis.
        However, some of the fundamental ideas presented by him remain relevant today. For example, the tension between
        database and narrative continues to be an important issue in the digital age, as we grapple with how to make
        sense of the vast amounts of data that are generated every day. Additionally, the idea that databases represent
        a new symbolic form of the computer age remains a compelling and relevant concept.
        Overall, while some of Manovich's predictions may not have come true in the exact way he envisioned, the ideas
        he presented continue to be relevant and thought-provoking today.

    <p class="question">
        3. Can you draw a connection between Manovich's ideas and your plan for your final project?
    </p>


    <p class="answer">
        The final project is a collection of all the work we have done in the semester. I want it to take the form of an
        interactive experience, aligning with Manovich’s idea of user-driven narratives. I have not completely thought
        out about how exactly the index page would look but it will include some user participation, inspired by
        Manovich’s focus on user participation in interactive narratives like computer games. Manovich’s insights
        transformed my view on databases’ symbolic importance, prompting an interactive and playful index.
