    <p class="question">
        1. What is the thesis of this article?
    </p>


    <p class="answer">
        The main idea of this article by J.R. Carpenter is the concept of the “handmade web”. The thesis posits that
        this represents a unique approach to web development, which includes manual coding and people building their own
        websites by using their own skills rather than relying on machines and corporate-aided web designs. The author
        argues that the handmade web, which started in the mid-1990s, contains a sense of personal connection,
        experimentation, and physical engagement with the internet. Carpenter claims that this approach not only
        emphasizes the physical act of creating web content but also serves as a form of resistance against the
        corporate-dominated internet.
        Furthermore, she says how the “handmade web” provides a unique historical context for understanding the
        internet’s evolution. She mentions that web pages created during that time frame retain their original form,
        serving as living artifacts that offer valuable insights into the internet's past. Additionally, the author also
        suggests that it is important to keep making websites this way despite the growing influence of multinational
        corporations on the internet.

    <p class="question">
        2. Carpenter describes the handmade web as a form of resistance. In your own words, what is being resisted?
    </p>

    <p class="answer">
        The handmade web represents a form of resistance against the growing dominance of corporate, standardization,
        and commercialization of the internet. Carpenter stands against these profit-driven large corporations that are
        trying to shape the online world.
        To begin with, the handmade web resists the takeover of the internet by multinational corporations. It stands
        against the idea that the internet should become a place where the corporate world takes over. She mentions that
        in the early days of the internet, there was an expectation that people would own their own websites that
        reflect their own individual selves and not be dependent on a few big sites to have an online presence. It
        resists standardization of web design and interaction and promotes individuality and creativity in web
        development.
        Additionally, it resists the idea of the internet as a commercial space, where all content is driven by profit.
        She emphasizes on personal, and experimental aspects of web design which also include content creation but
        without the goal of making money from it.

    <p class="question">
        3. Reflecting on your own experiences, what are other examples of drawing attention to the "physicality" of the
        web?
    </p>


    <p class="answer">
        There are a few examples that include the physical aspect of the internet.
        • There used to be physical objects like CDs that were similar to the content available on the internet. For
        example, operating systems installations could be accessed via CDs and offline. We would install software from
        the disc instead of downloading it online.
        • We used to watch movies by purchasing the DVD of that movie and playing it on the controller, all offline.
        • Playing video games like Play Station or Xbox involves physical movement via a controller.
        • QR codes – scanning a code physically on the camera of the phone would lead one to a link or a specific
        webpage.
        • Google Maps “live view” feature that tells us which direction to go by pointing the camera in the area around
        us.
